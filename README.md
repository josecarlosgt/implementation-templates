# Websites for Good: Implementation Templates
## Phase Three: Webpage Implementation

In this repository, you will find templates containing CSS rules and examples of color schemes that you can use to implement your mockup. A color scheme is a combination of colors used in the design of a webpage. Try using the color schemes in the template before creating your own.

When customizing the template, ensure you address all the comments given as "ToDo." 

All the templates use Bootstrap CSS via a CDN. To implement Bootstrap JavaScript-based components, you will need to add Bootstrap JavaScript to your page.
