# Websites for Good: Implementation Templates
## Phase Three: Webpage Implementation

In this repository, you will find templates containing CSS rules and examples of color schemes that you can use to implement your mockup. A color scheme is a combination of colors used in the design of a webpage. Try using the color schemes in the template before creating your own.

When customizing the template, address all the comments written as "ToDo." 

All the templates use Bootstrap CSS via a CDN. To implement Bootstrap JavaScript-based components, you will need to add Bootstrap JavaScript to your page.
